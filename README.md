spotifyripper

small ripper script for spotify (rips playlists to mp3 and includes ID3 tags) 

note that stream ripping violates the ToC's of libspotify!

-----
    ./jbripper.py [username] [password] [spotify_url]

    "./jbripper.py user pass spotify:user:[user]:playlist:7HC9PMdSbwGBBn3EVTaCNx rips entire playlist

features
--------
* real-time VBR ripping from spotify PCM stream

* writes id3 tags (including album covers)

* creates files and directories based on the following structure artist/album/song.mp3

prerequisites:
--------------
* libspotify (download at https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/)
